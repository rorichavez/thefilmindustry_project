# The Film Industry

## Introduction
This project aims to guide decision-making for an audiovisual production studio by analyzing trends in content consumption over the past decade. By leveraging data from major platforms such as Amazon and Netflix, we seek to identify patterns in genres, directors, and audience preferences to inform our content creation strategy for the upcoming year.

## Data Sources and Analysis
### Data Used:
We utilized datasets from Kaggle, supplemented with web scraping and API integration for additional information extraction. The main challenges included familiarizing ourselves with web scraping and API integration, followed by developing functions to extract the required content. Visualizations posed another challenge initially, as determining the appropriate grouping for desired outcomes required experimentation.

### Strengths & Weaknesses:
- **Strengths:** Rich dataset spanning multiple years, access to additional information through web scraping and API integration.
- **Weaknesses:** Initial learning curve for web scraping and API integration, potential biases in data collection methods.

## Questions to Answer
1. **Content Distribution**:
   - *Conclusion:* Movies dominate both Amazon and Netflix, comprising over 60% of content on each platform.

2. **Popular Genres**:
   - *Conclusion:* The primary genres across platforms include comedy, action & adventure, documentary, with drama being the most prominent.

3. **Director Preferences**:
   - *Conclusion:* Notable directors such as Canis Holder, Arthur van Merwijk, and Jay Chapman are associated with various genres, including children's movies and comedy.

4. **Production Countries**:
   - *Conclusion:* The USA, India, UK, Canada, Spain, and Nigeria are the primary producers of content.

5. **Audience Preferences**:
   - *Conclusion:* Audience preferences favor genres like action and adventure, drama, animation, and directors such as Christopher Nolan, Joe Russo, and James Mangold.

## Methodology
Our methodology involved the following steps:
1. Data Collection: Obtaining datasets from Kaggle and extracting additional information through web scraping and API integration.
2. Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling null values, renaming columns, and consolidating data.
3. Analysis: Exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in content distribution, genres, directors, production countries, and audience preferences.
4. Visualization: Creating visualizations to present findings effectively.
5. Conclusion: Summarizing key insights and implications for content creation strategy.

## Conclusions
- There's a mismatch between available content and audience preferences, highlighting the importance of aligning content strategy with audience expectations.
- Understanding trends in genres, director preferences, and audience ratings is essential for making informed decisions in content creation.
